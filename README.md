# DataFlow 

<br />

- *Visit https://datafloww.netlify.app/ or http://www.datafloww.online/ for a working preview of the static portion of the website so far. I'm still trying to find a workaround for database and backend deployment using google sheets to serve as an API endpoint and Now.sh or Heroku to host my backend. Thus, user log-in, sign-up, and comments will be disabled in the current DataFlow iteration.*
